The Shell and System Calls
===============================

Major Assignment 1

##### Created By

Alex, Edgar, Luis, and Russell

##### Design Overview

A shell implemenation that can be run in interactive or batch mode.

##### Complete Specification

To compile the program, execute:

    $ make

	C language used is C99

To run the program, execute:

    $ ./shell [batchFile]

- **batchFile**: an optional argument (indicated by square brackets as above). If present, the shell will read each line of the batchFile for commands to be executed and will exit when it reaches a `quit` command, the end of the file, or if you enter '`Ctrl-D`'. If not present, the shell will run in interactive mode by printing a prompt to the user at stdout and reading the command stdin.

For example, if you run the program as:

    $ ./shell /home/mat0299/csce3600/batchFile

then the shell will read commands from `/home/mat0299/csce3600/batchFile` until it sees the `quit` command, it reaches the end of file, or you tyep '`Ctrl-D`'/'`Ctrl-C`'.

Alternatively, if you run the program as:

    $ ./shell

then the shell will display an interactive prompt:

    prompt>

This interactive shell will accept commands and display output until you quit the program.

You may execute multiple commands in interactive mode or in batch files by separating them with a "`;`". Such as:

    prompt> ls -l; who; ps

which would output something similar to this:

Commands are run simultaneously, which means that some of the output may be intermixed. This is by design.

To exit the shell, simply provide a `quit` command. This will cause the shell to exit and will stop processing any more commands.

##### Directory Structure

Directory   |   Description
-------     |   --------
/docs  	      |   Program documentation.
/src 	      |   Source(.c), header(.h), and make files.
/src/test     |   Testing/debugging files.
README.md         |   Basic documentation and information.
