##### Design Overview

A shell implementation that can be run in interactive or batch mode.

##### Complete Specification

To compile the program automatically, execute:

    $ make

To compile the program manually, execute:

    $ gcc -std=c99 -Wall -o shell main.c

To run the program, execute:

    $ ./shell [batchFile]

- **batchFile**: an optional argument (indicated by square brackets as above). If present, the shell will read each line of the batchFile for commands to be executed and will exit when it reaches a `quit` command, the end of the file, or if you enter '`Ctrl-D`'. If not present, the shell will run in interactive mode by printing a prompt to the user at stdout and reading the command stdin.

For example, if you run the program as:

    $ ./shell /home/mat0299/csce3600/batchFile

then the shell will read commands from `/home/mat0299/csce3600/batchFile` until it sees the `quit` command, it reaches the end of file, or you type '`Ctrl-D`'/'`Ctrl-C`'.

Alternatively, if you run the program as:

    $ ./shell

then the shell will display an interactive prompt:

    $ ./shell
    -----[ INTERACTIVE MODE ]-----
    --> Type "help" to view commands
    
    prompt> 

This interactive shell will accept commands and display output until you `quit` the program.

To view a list of internal commands, type `help`:

    $ prompt> help
    /--------[ HELP: LIST OF INTERNAL COMMANDS ]-------\
    | history       - prints list of commands entered  |
    | prompt        - sets custom prompt string        |
    | customize     - sets customized shell options    |
    | path          - sets PATH directory              |
    | cd            - change current directory         |
    | quit OR exit  - exits shell program              |
    \--------------------------------------------------/

You may execute multiple commands in interactive mode or in batch files by separating them with a "`;`". Such as:

    prompt> ls -l; who; ps

which would output something similar to this:

Commands are run simultaneously, which means that some of the output may be intermixed. This is by design.

To exit the shell, simply type `quit`. This will cause the shell to stop processing any more commands and will exit.

To remove executable and object files, execute:

    $ make clean
